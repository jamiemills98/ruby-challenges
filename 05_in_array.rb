# Methods

# Write a method called 'in_array' which will take 
# two parameteres:
# One as a string and one as an array of strings
in_array = "hello", [" hi, hola, hello"]
# Return a boolean indicationg whether or not the
# string is found in the array.
"hello" == "hello"

# Test your solution with:
# ruby tests/05_in_array_test.rb

# Example:
# "hello", ["hi","howdy","hello"] should return true.

def in_array (needle, haystack)
  # Your code here
end


# Beast Mode:

# Redo the challenge but try solving it again in a different way.
